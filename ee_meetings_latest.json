They say that failure is a better teacher than success, and we have abused this idiom these past eight years. We humbly present to you, then, a window into the future (and past): aim for the cloud[s]; misapply ORM - thrice; see only nails when the only tool available is a hammer; Strings are not only attached but entangled in everything; multiple not-invented-here syndromes. We have all been here at least once.",

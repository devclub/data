            "At a certain point in a tech company’s lifespan, it becomes abundantly clear that not all undertakings are completely successful. This point is nigh for Playtech as well, where previously hidden deficiencies may now be illuminated in searing light. Here, cautionary tales, unexpected outcomes, shocking revelations – all will be explored during this journey through some of Playtech’s most infamous mishaps.",
            "Not every beginning has a happy ending… or any ending. Regardless of the outcome, most undertakings leave us with experiences we lacked when we started. They say that failure is a better teacher than success, and we have abused this idiom these past eight years. We humbly present to you, then, a window into the future (and past): aim for the cloud[s]; misapply ORM - thrice; see only nails when the only tool available is a hammer; Strings are not only attached but entangled in everything; multiple not-invented-here syndromes. We have all been here at least once.",
            "One of the definitive characteristics of the consummate professional is the honest ability to recognize faults, even when those faults are touted as best practices; to address the process(es) which led to the cultivation of such deficiencies, and to have the courage to bring these issues to the forefront, even in the face of conventional thinking."

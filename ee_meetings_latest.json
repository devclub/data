Whether you’re new to ML or you’ve already built your own custom model, by the end of this talk you’ll know how to get started adding NLP to your own application. I’ll begin by introducing the Cloud Natural Language API, which lets you utilize a pre-trained model to get insights from your text with a single API call. Then I’ll discuss how to build a custom model trained on your own data using TensorFlow and Cloud ML Engine, with lots of live demos along the way."

This is why companies discovered that some actions which were being repeated for a number of times could be automated what was the basis for Automation Testing.",

This means that work of the QA team members is limited to creating simple auto tests and doing some manual testing where it takes less effort than creating an auto test.",
            "At the same time, having this idea HR officers are hiring people who are unable to bring QA forward in order to achieve better quality of the product. Ideally, the person who is the one responsible for quality should be involved in the process of development and not just having to assess what has been already done as well as to be able not only to test the product, but to be able to understand why the mistake has occurred what is possible only in case if QA specialist has sufficient programming background.",

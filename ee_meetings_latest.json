Often, developers or managers, stressed by impending deadlines, worsen their situation by adopting even more inefficient practices or intentionally accruing technical debt, further complicating their circumstances.",
            "In this talk, I'll explain why some popular practices might not be as effective as commonly believed, highlighting the actual problems they solve and the specific situations in which they could be beneficial. These examples draw from my 20+ years of experience and the recognition of my company, Codeborne, as one of the more quick and efficient software development partners.",
            "Let's reconsider how teams can work more enjoyably and efficiently, minimizing wasted time. The goal is to illustrate that there are alternative, more effective ways to develop software and to give you ideas to make better choices when initiating a new project or improving your current practices."

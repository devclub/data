            "An AI chatbot like ChatGPT can not answer questions about unfamiliar topics, recent events after 2021, or non-public documents. This task gets even more complicated when you deal with data that constantly changes. What should you do?",
            "This presentation showcases a solution to these hurdles. You will learn how to build your AI app and how language models such as those provided by OpenAI (Embeddings) and Pathway Python libraries can query real-time data intelligently without vector databases. This method opens up the potential to build solid systems for retrieving information, recommending content, or even making chatbots that answer user questions based on ever-changing streaming data."

These companies, lured by the promise of rapid growth and success, fail to assess the long-term consequences of their spending choices. As a result, they find themselves grappling with bloated budgets, inefficient processes, and limited runway to sustain their operations, not to mention laying off the staff, they were so eager to hire.",

            "This presentation showcases a solution to these hurdles. You will learn how to build your AI app and how language models such as those provided by OpenAI (Embeddings) and Pathway Python libraries can query real-time data intelligently without vector databases. This method opens up the potential to build solid systems for retrieving information, recommending content, or even making chatbots that answer user questions based on ever-changing streaming data."

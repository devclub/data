            "When you're a developer, it often feels like managers get in the way of “real work,” don’t understand priorities, and generally slow down progress. In this talk, I’ll share how my perspective changed after I went through the journey from developer to CTO. Why management makes “strange” decisions, how a product looks from different levels, and what’s actually behind what seems like sabotage. This talk is an honest insider’s look and an attempt to build a bridge between code and management."
